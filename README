Weewar Bot Platform
===================

For now, there is no much to see.

Later a bot will be created to play on weewar.com
Later this will become a platform to develop Bot
Later I will be happy
Later I will code something else.
But now, let's code !

Setup
=====

Edit a "key.txt" file in the weewar directory and write your login and development key in it as "login:key"
for example: Daydz:8f9t6U5Fnkuede23z79iRcmBn

ruby main.rb to start a interatice prompt
ruby weewar.rb to start the bot alone
