Weewar Bot Platform
===================

For now, there is no much to see.

Later a bot will be created to play on weewar.com
Later this will become a platform to develop Weewar Bots
But now, let's code !

Setup
=====

Install XmlSimple
  gem install 'xml-simple'

Edit a "accounts.txt" file in the weewar directory and write your login and development key in it as "name:login:key"
an account by line.
  for example:
  a:ai_Daydz:8f9t6U5Fnkuede23z79iRcmBn
  o:ai_Other:3d26h8jU5Fnku23z79is8y7T

The important part is the login:key.
The name will be used to switch account easily.
You can choose what you want as a name.

to start a interatice prompt
  ruby main.rb
to start the bot alone
  ruby weewar.rb
