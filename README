Weewar Bot Platform
===================

For now, there is no much to see.

Later a bot will be created to play on weewar.com
Later this will become a platform to develop Weewar Bots
But now, let's code !

Statuts
=======

It can accept games, and play.

But it is not intelligent at all for now.
It creates some infantery and go for the first ennemie base it finds,
attacking ennemies in the way.

It is the basic loop weewar-ai put in it :)
Have to code the AI part now :)


Setup
=====

Install XmlSimple
  gem install 'xml-simple'

Edit a "accounts.txt" file in the weewar directory and write your login and development key in it as "name:login:key"
an account by line.
  for example:
  a:ai_Daydz:8f9t6U5Fnkuede23z79iRcmBn
  o:ai_Other:3d26h8jU5Fnku23z79is8y7T

The important part is the login:key.
The name will be used to switch account easily.
You can choose what you want as a name.

to start a interatice prompt
  ruby main.rb
to start the bot alone
  ruby weewar.rb

Thanks

TODO
====

- catch error and send them as chat msg if possible
- welcome chat msg
- better pathfinding, take into account the terrains
- Code AI !


Questions:
Do we have to remember unit state (with their goal) between states ?
Or the AI should be able to assign again the same goals (or not depending on the situation) between turns ?
The situation needs to be evaluated anyway, but the AI should not forget what was the unit goals (or not?).

Do we need a DB to store game states with goals?
Or the AI can recreate theml between sessions ?
