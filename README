Weewar Bot Platform
===================

For now, it is just a Weewar bot doing nothing but a very basic and lame strategy.
Later this will become a platform to develop Weewar Bots (I hope!)
with its own programmation language. See my othre project Calculette for an example.

But now, let's code !

Statuts
=======

It can accept games, and play.

But it is not intelligent at all for now.
It creates some infantery and go for the first ennemie base it finds,
attacking ennemies in the way.

It is the basic loop weewar-ai put in it :)
Have to code the AI part now :)


Setup
=====

Install XmlSimple
  gem install 'xml-simple'

Edit a "accounts.txt" file in the weewar directory and write your login and development key in it as "name:login:key"
an account by line.
  for example:
  a:ai_Daydz:8f9t6U5Fnkuede23z79iRcmBn
  o:ai_Other:3d26h8jU5Fnku23z79is8y7T

The important part is the login:key.
The name will be used to switch account easily.
You can choose what you want as a name.

to start a interatice prompt
  ruby main.rb
to start the bot alone
  ruby weewar.rb

Thanks

TODO
====

ordered by priority

- put all sources in lib/ and put basic in a new bot instance
- blog entry !
- bug: it remained two my_bases but it didn't build anything
  apparently we need to refresh the map too with the method 'maplayout'
- see if we can not generate all xml first and send all xml at once to server
- pretty print for hashes and arrays (does Calculette has this already?)
- Can't move ai_ChuckBot: linf@(3,3) to base @ (5,5)
  if pathfinder can't find a way because of a movable unit, it shall find the target closest hex to go.
  or at least there should be an options for.
- better pathfinding, take into account the terrains
- stop calling helping methods from weewawr.com, the bot shall calculate all by itself
- Code AI ! based on Bot.rb

Questions:
  Do we have to remember unit state (with their goal) between states ?
  Or the AI should be able to assign again the same goals (or not depending on the situation) between turns ?
  The situation needs to be evaluated anyway, but the AI should not forget what was the unit goals (or not?).

  Do we need a DB to store game states with goals?
  Or the AI can recreate them between sessions ?
